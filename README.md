# Launch-Vehicle-Historical-Analysis
An exploration of global launch vehicle history from 1957 to today, showcasing the evolution of launch sites, providers and vehicle designs as well as where we are heading now in the New Space Era.

## Project Goal
To explore Tableau for the first time by learning custom geocoding, multi-layer mapping, and data visualization techniques. Gained insights into space launch history, analyzing trends in launch sites, vehicle types, and the growing role of private sector providers.

## Insights
- **Shift in Launch Activity**: A significant increase in global launch sites and providers since 2000, especially from the private sector.
- **Historical Dominance**: Early launch activity was concentrated in the U.S. and USSR, driven by Cold War competition.
- **Most Active Launch Vehicle**: The Soyuz series holds the record for the most launches, with a ~98% success rate since 1966, though it is quickly being challenged by privately built launch vehicles like the Falcon 9.
- **Launch Activity Low Point**: Global launches hit a low in 2005 before rapidly increasing over the next two decades. This global reduction raises further questions on if tied to the Columbia disaster in 2003 or larger geoplitical concerns in the early 2000s.
