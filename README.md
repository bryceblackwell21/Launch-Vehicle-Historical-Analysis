# ðŸš€ Launch Vehicle Historical Analysis

An exploration of global launch vehicle history from 1957 to today, showcasing the evolution of launch sites, providers, vehicle designs, and trends in the New Space Era.

## Project Goal
To gain insights into the history and trends of space launches through Tableau visualizations, including custom geocoding, multi-layer mapping, and interlocked trend analysis.

## Insights
- **Shift in Launch Activity**: Significant increase in launch sites and providers since 2000, driven by private sector growth.
- **Historical Dominance**: Initial launches concentrated in the U.S. and USSR due to Cold War influence.
- **Most Active Vehicle**: The Soyuz series holds the record for the most launches, though it faces competition from newer private vehicles like Falcon 9.
- **Launch Activity Low Point**: Launches hit a low in 2005 before surging, possibly influenced by the 2003 Columbia disaster or geopolitical factors.
